Neurological data has shown that anxiety and time management are the main barriers in everyday decision making among teen-adults. According to David Finkel, 'The Freedom Formula: How to Succeed in Business Without Sacrificing Your Family, Health, or Life', we waste 21.8 hours per week.

Personalized Timetable
-----
Using the FitBit, we have analysed the average heart rate and implemented a constantly updating heart rate data collection system. We compared this to online datasets of body temperature and heart rate to create a personalized schedule based on your own database. This organizes your tasks such as homework, meetings, exercise, and best sleep times to optimize your day.

Smart Alarm
-----
The Smart Alarm analyzes  your sleep patterns and when you are supposed to be awake to maximize the duration of sleep you have per night. By waking our users up in a non-REM state, users will be more energetic and alert throughout the day which increases productivity.

Optimized Decision Making
-----
Through the correlation between dopamine release by frontal lobes and how this interacts with the user’s heart rate, we create an individualized database on Google Cloud where users can obtain information on your optimal mental state to make a decision. The app tells users about how accurate their decision making skills are at a certain time.

In-App Stock Trading and Interactive Graphs
-----
As decision making is key to stock trading, our app enhances stock traders’ experience by optimizing their trades. In order to do this, we have implemented an intuitive in-app stock trading page where users can buy and sell their shares. Our app also provides updates on your weekly gains and losses, and advises users on the best stock trading strategies through interactive graphs from the BlackRock Aladdin's API.

Stock Trading Verification
-----
Being aware of the decisions you've made in the past is very important when trading stocks. To help our users accomplish this, we have created an easy-to-use system which sends you a summary of all transactions in the past week, which the user can verify using DocuSign. This allows us to maintain the security and privacy of the user while giving them direct access to their transaction history.

ChatBot and Notification System with Machine Learning
-----
We used the machine learning to sort data retrieved from the Goldman Sachs' database on fundamental attributes of stocks to update users with the most accurate and crucial data through a ChatBot. In order to implement this, we used Microsoft’s Azure Bot Service that provided us with a platform to create an intelligent chat bot that understand the meaning of each instruction given.
